          <h2>Origins of Coffee</h2>
          <p>
            Legend has it that coffee was discovered by an Ethiopian goat herder
            named Kaldi in the 9th century. He noticed his goats became more
            energetic after eating berries from a certain tree. Curious, Kaldi
            tried the berries himself and experienced a similar boost in energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            From Ethiopia, coffee spread to the Arab world where it became an
            integral part of their culture. By the 15th century, coffee was
            being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia and was consumed in
            coffeehouses known as qahveh khaneh.

          <h2>Spread of Coffee Across the World</h2>
          <p>
            Coffee's popularity continued to grow, and by the 17th century, it
            had reached Europe. The first coffeehouse in Europe opened in Venice
            in 1645, followed by coffeehouses in England, France, and other
            European countries.

          <p>
            In the 18th century, coffee cultivation spread to the Americas. The
            Dutch brought coffee plants to their colonies in Java (Indonesia),
            and later to Suriname, French Guiana, and the Caribbean. Coffee also
            made its way to Brazil, which would become the world's largest
            coffee producer.
