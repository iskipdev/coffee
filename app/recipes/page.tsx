        <h2 className="text-xl mt-5 mb-1">Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            1. Preheat your espresso machine: Make sure your machine is properly
            heated before pulling your shot. This ensures that the water reaches
            the optimal temperature for extracting the coffee flavors.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Grind your coffee beans: Grind your coffee beans to a fine
            consistency, similar to table salt. The grind size is crucial for
            the extraction process. Experiment to find the right grind size that
            suits your taste preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Prepare your portafilter: Fill your portafilter basket with
            freshly ground coffee. Use a tamper to evenly press down the coffee
            grounds. The pressure applied should be firm and even to ensure
            uniform extraction.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Flush the espresso machine: Before pulling your shot, it's a good
            practice to flush the espresso machine by running a small amount of
            hot water through the portafilter. This helps to heat up the
            equipment and remove any residual coffee oils.
          </li>
          <li>
            5. Pull your shot: Place your prepared portafilter into the espresso
            machine's group head. Start the extraction process and watch as the
            rich, aromatic espresso flows into your shot glass or cup. A
            standard shot of espresso typically takes around 25-30 seconds to
            extract.
          </li>
          <li>
            6. Evaluate your shot: Pay attention to the color, crema, and aroma
            of your espresso shot. The crema should be thick and golden-brown,
            indicating a well-extracted shot. Take note of any flavors or
            nuances present in the coffee.
          </li>
          <li>
            7. Serve and enjoy: Once you've pulled the perfect shot, serve it
            immediately. Sip and savor the rich, intense flavors of your freshly
            brewed espresso. If desired, add a pinch of sugar to enhance the
            sweetness.
          </li>
          <li>
            8. Clean up: After enjoying your espresso, remember to clean your
            espresso machine and equipment thoroughly to maintain optimal
            performance and flavor.
          </li>
        </ol>
